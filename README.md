![Design preview for the IP address tracker coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out this front-end repository.
<br>

## The Project

My aim was to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, I'll be using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, I  used [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).


- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.


* React JS https://reactjs.org/
* Bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/






<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

<!-- 1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com) -->
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/priyanshpsalian/IP-Address-Tracker.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm i
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
4. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   visit http://localhost:3000/
   ```
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT** ‚ö†Ô∏è: To use the IP Geolocation API by IPify, you'll need to sign up for a free account. You won't need to add any cards details to do this and it's a very quick process. This will generate an API Key for you. Usually, you would be able to restrict your API Key to a specific URL (your own domain). This makes sure that other people can't use your API Key on their own websites. IPify doesn't have this feature, but because you aren't adding your card details, this isn't an issue. **So be sure to only sign up for the free account and DO NOT enter any card details**.

For the mapping API, we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/). It's free to use and doesn't require an API Key. If you decide to use another API, like Google Maps or Mapbox, be sure to secure your API Key. Here are guides for both Google Maps and Mapbox, be sure to read through them thoroughly:

- [API Key best practices from Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/maps/api-key-best-practices)
- [How to use Mapbox securely](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/how-to-use-mapbox-securely/)

Exposing your API Key publicly can lead to other people using it to make requests for their own application if the proper precautions aren't in place. Please be sure you read the guides thoroughly and follow their recommendations.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
